Here’s a suitable README.md for your LongBookWriter project, written with clarity, ambition, and technical detail to match your vision and implementation:

📚 LongBookWriter
LongBookWriter is an autonomous novel-writing system powered by memory-augmented agents and long-context language modeling. It is designed to write high-quality, stylistically consistent, and creatively coherent long-form fiction — especially in the style of Chinese internet novels (网络小说).

🌟 Project Ambition
Most AI writing tools are designed for short outputs or require frequent human steering. LongBookWriter aims to flip that paradigm by:

Maintaining a persistent world model (characters, arcs, lore)

Using retrieval-based memory to match style and story continuity

Running a loop of autonomous reasoning to plan and generate chapters

Supporting multi-chapter, serialized novel creation with minimal input

Ultimately, the goal is to build an agent that can autonomously write entire books, evolve characters, reflect on story progression, and remain faithful to literary tone — all while being interpretable, steerable, and extensible.

🧠 Architecture Overview
LongBookWriter is structured as a LangGraph-powered agent using three memory layers:

1. 🔮 Long-Term Memory
A persistent longterm_doc.md file contains:

Main characters (traits, goals, speech style)

World-building elements (factions, magic systems, geography)

Major plot arcs and lore

Readable and editable by the agent for continuity

2. 📚 RAG-Based Context
A vector store (mocked in MWP) stores:

Previously generated chapters

Style references from seed novels

Used to match tone and retrieve similar plot patterns

3. 🧾 Short-Term Summary
Rolling summary (3–5 sentences) of recent events

Updated automatically to inform the next scene

Prevents forgetting while keeping generation coherent

🔁 Agent Workflow
Each generation step is a multi-stage LangGraph workflow:
